 What I learned

I learnt how to justify a container using a max/min height and weight.I've been having issues trying to place all in the container 


```css
.body{background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh; }
```
```css 
.white{
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 15px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 40px hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    padding: 4%;
    top: 25%;
    text-align: center;
    width: 375px;} 
```
Continued development
I would like to make my own QR Generator so this could be used as a default template.

The qr code could be links to a document or something along those ways. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.

Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.Flexboxfroggy.com) - This helped me to understand how to use flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
